jQuery plugin for drag/drop uploads in HTML5
==============================
Based on the examples of Mika Tuupola (http://www.appelsiini.net/2009/10/html5-drag-and-drop-multiple-file-upload) and the jquery-filedrop plugin by Weixi Yen (https://github.com/weixiyen/jquery-filedrop)

- NOT an in-place replacement for jquery.filedrop.js

- Fixes multiple bad practices

- Adds event for when File is added to queue

- Still uses HTML5 FileReader() to read file data

- Improved code documentation
